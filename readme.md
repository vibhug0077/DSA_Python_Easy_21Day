# 21-Day LeetCode Challenge (100 Problems)

A structured 21-day plan to finish **100 beginner-friendly LeetCode problems** with consistent daily practice.

## How to use
- Solve **5 problems/day** (Days 1–20).
- **Day 21 = Revision Day** (6 problems: timed re-solve + notes).
- After solving each day, tick the checkbox and add brief notes (pattern, edge cases, mistakes).

## Rules (recommended)
- Timebox per problem:
  - Easy: 20–30 min
  - If stuck: read hints → implement → revisit next day
- Always write:
  - Approach (1–3 lines)
  - Time/Space complexity
  - 1 tricky test case
